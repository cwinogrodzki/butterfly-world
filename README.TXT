Project: butterfly-world
Authors: Claire Winogrodzki (framework by Michael Kölling and David J. Barnes)

This project is a simple choose-your-own-adventure game based on the framework included in the textbook “Objects First with Java - A Practical Introduction using BlueJ.”

In this game, you are a butterfly in a world of gardens and meadows. There is no objective to the game other than exploring and finding different flowers around butterfly world. To play the game, go to your terminal and compile + run the java file 'zuul', and the game should start from there. If you are stuck, enter ‘help’ to see instructions on how to play the game.
